# hi-generic-letter-metadata-editor
A generic editor for letter metadata

Note: this was the initial repository where we set up the generic profiles. It was used in a test session with students, who entered metadata from Buchelius letters. The data is moved to a dedicated Buchelius letters repository (https://github.com/knaw-huc/letter-buchelius-metadata), and the generic elements of this repository were moved to a new repository (https://github.com/knaw-huc/letter-generic-metadata-editor/). New projects will be forks of that repository.

This repository is archived and no longer in use (the Editor: now points to the other repository)
